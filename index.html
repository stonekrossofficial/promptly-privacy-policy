<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 19, 2026</p>

<h2>1. Simple Data Philosophy</h2>
<p>Promptly is designed to provide AI prompts with minimal data collection. We do not require account creation, and we do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, or contact details.</p>

<h2>2. Information We Handle</h2>
<p><strong>Technical Logs:</strong> We use standard tools (Firebase) to monitor app stability and crashes.</p>
<p><strong>Content Delivery:</strong> Prompts and images are delivered via secure cloud servers.</p>
<p><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Images may be cached locally for performance. You can clear this cache anytime.</p>

<h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>We use Google Firebase for analytics. We also include the Google Mobile Ads SDK for technical integration, though ads are not currently displayed. These services may collect anonymous device identifiers.</p>

<h2>4. Data Deletion</h2>
<p>Since there are no user accounts, uninstalling the app removes all locally stored data.</p>
